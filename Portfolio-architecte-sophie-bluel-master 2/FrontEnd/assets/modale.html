<p>Ummm…to eBay? And then the battle's not so bad? Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
<p>Say what? Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? <strong> I meant 'physically'.</strong> <em> Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food?</em> I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
<h2>And then the battle's not so bad?</h2>
<p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</p>

<li>Throw her in the brig.</li><li>Oh yeah, good luck with that.</li><li>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</li>

<h3>No! The cat shelter's on to me.</h3>
<p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I don't want to be rescued.</p>
<ul>
<li>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</li><li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li><li>You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</li>

<p>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
<p>She also liked to shut up! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
<p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. One hundred dollars. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
<p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Tell her she looks thin. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</p>
<p>No, she'll probably make me do it. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
<p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Large bet on myself in round one. Ooh, name it after me! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
<p>Now what? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
<p>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Soothe us with sweet lies. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
<p>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Take me to your leader! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</p>
